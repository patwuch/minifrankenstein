# a 2024 summer edition of mary shelley's frankenstein 

This repository hosts the Text as Data II final project at the University of Antwerp. It is a mini digital edition of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelleyâ€™s "Frankenstein," from the Bodleian MS. Abinger c.56 manuscript. Its overall design is inspired by bold, thrashy aesthetics of early internet to echo Mary Shelley's subversion of expectation and challenging of norms.
